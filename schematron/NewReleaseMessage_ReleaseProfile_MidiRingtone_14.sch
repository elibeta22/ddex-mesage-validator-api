   <s:p>Failing a rule with a role of 'Fatal Error' means that the Conformance Tester must recommend
      to not award a Conformance Certificate or to retract a Conformance Certificate if one has
      already been issued. Failing a rule with a role of 'Conditional Fatal Error' is the same as a
      'Fatal Error', however, the rule may be ignored if the Conformance Tester has no means of
      asserting whether the condition expressed in the rule has been met.</s:p>
   <s:p>Failing a rule a rule with a role of 'Error' means that the Conformance Tester must
      recommend to award a Partial Conformance Certificate or to downgrade a Conformance Certificate
      that has already been issued. However, if more than 1 rules (representing 50% of all rules
      with a role of 'Error' or 'Conditional Error') have been failed at least once, the Conformance
      Tester must recommend to not award a Conformance Certificate or to retract a Conformance
      Certificate if one has already been issued. Failing a rule with a role of 'Conditional Error'
      is the same as an 'Error', however, the rule may be ignored if the Conformance Tester has no
      means of asserting whether the condition expressed in the rule has been met.</s:p>
